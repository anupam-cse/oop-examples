Inheriting from a Class

class animal:
 type = "mammal"
class dog(animal):
 breed = "labrador"
 
 
>>> my_dog = dog()
>>> my_dog.breed
labrador
>>> my_dog.type
mammal

As you can see, the class dog inherits the attribute of the animal type. The way
methods and attributes are resolved is that the main class is checked first to see if it exists
there. If it doesn't, then Python will check any inherited class to see if the attribute or
method exists there. This means that you can override inherited methods or attributes
with your own version
