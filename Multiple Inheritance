As you can see, order matters when dealing with multiple inheritances. When
Python tries to resolve where a method or attribute is defined, it begins with the main
class and then continues through the inherited classes in order from left to right until it
finds the first instance of said method or attribute. In the above case, the correct order of
inheritance should be class eagle(bird, animal).
