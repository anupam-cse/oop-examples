Adding Private Fields
wish to have some parts of your class privateâ€”that is, not accessible from other
pieces of code.

Creating a Private Variable

class priv_vars:
 __a__ = "This is a private variable"

There is a special form of a private name that induces Python to rename the element
using a system of name mangling. If you have an element that may have the same name
as some other element, you can add at least two leading underscore characters and at
most one trailing underscore. Python will then prepend the class name to the element
name. For example, if you had a class like

class my_class1:
 __a_ = 1

the attribute __a_ would be renamed as _my_class__a_ in order to avoid name collision.
